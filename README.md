A very simple worm written in MS-Batch (designed for Windows 10 21H1, should work on Windows 11)

A payload could easily be added, though I created this just for testing some stuff, and as such have not included one. It also wouldn't be very good for that, as it's easy to detect and really only spreads using network drives.
